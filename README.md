```

## Running

```shell
$ go run ./cmd/cli
[...]
```

- Or run this after having build the command:

```shell
$ ./cli
[...]
```

## Running Tests

- Run the testsuite with coverage enabled (alternatively `$ task test` if you are using [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/)):

```shell
$ go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
?       github.com/TheDonDope/gordle/cmd/cli    [no test files]
ok      github.com/TheDonDope/gordle/pkg/guessing       0.125s  coverage: 63.8% of statements
ok      github.com/TheDonDope/gordle/pkg/storage        0.001s  coverage: 33.3% of statements
```
